It has hosted three of the six South American Championship/Copa América football competitions held in Peru. It is referred to as the Coloso de José Díaz because of its proximity to a street of the same name. It is the home ground of the Peru national football team. The IPD (Peruvian Sport Institute)—a branch of the Ministry of Education—is the stadium's administrating entity. The stadium has undergone several renovations for tournaments such as the 2004 Copa América. The artificial turf was installed for the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship. It will probably be used at the 2021 FIFA U-17 World Cup. The most recent renovation started in 2010 and concluded in 2011.

The stadium was named after the Peruvian mestizo Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and inaugurated in 1960, with an initial capacity of 30,000. It is owned by the Instituto Peruano del Deporte (Peruvian Institute of Sport). The increase in spectator capacity came after CONMEBOL chose Peru to host the Copa América 2004, prompting the Peruvian government to invest in a five-million dollar renovation program for its stadia, including the Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega. Its renovation cost approximately $1,720,000, which helped boost its official spectator capacity to 42,056. The stadium ended up hosting the third place game of the Copa América 2004. Thanks to the event, the city of Cusco received even more tourists than it already receives as Peru's top tourist destination. The Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega is also recognized as one of the most beautiful stadiums in all of South America. This recognition is due to its well-maintained grass and its resistance to the sometimes aggressive and highly variable climate of the city of Cuzco. The awe is the stadium's perpetual beauty even after these climates. It is this resistive beauty that inspires soccer commentators and visitors alike. The stadium is currently home to three football clubs. The first two original clubs since the 1950s are Cienciano of the Peruvian Second Division and Deportivo Garcilaso of the Copa Perú. The third is the recently formed club Real Garcilaso, which was promoted to the First Division at the end of 2011. This will set up a much anticipated Cusco derby match",

Comerciantes Unidos was founded as Los Comerciantes by Abdias Cieza Tapia, Juan Tarrillo Castro, and Jorge Salas Toro in 2001. That year they were promoted to their local district league. In 2002, they became an official club and changed their name to Club Social Deportivo y Cultural Comerciantes Unidos. In 2008, they reached the Copa Perú National Stage for the first time. In 2010, they were invited to participate in La Liga Superior de Cajamarca which groups the best teams from the Cajamarca Region and gives direct access to the Department Stage of the Copa Perú. that same year they reached the National Stage of the Copa Peru once more. In 2013, they once more reached the Copa Perú National Stage and were invited to participate in the Peruvian Segunda División. Comerciantes Unidos played its first season in the Peruvian Segunda División in the neighboring province of Santa Cruz due to their home stadium being remodeled. This was very difficult for the team and their fans. The team finished the season 14th, only 5 points away from relegation. During the 2015 season, Carlos Cortijo, who had won the Segunda División tournament the year before, was hired as the new manager by club president Aníbal Pedraza Aguilar.

The stadium was named after the Peruvian mestizo Inca Garcilaso de la Vega and inaugurated in 1960, with an initial capacity of 30,000. It is owned by the Instituto Peruano del Deporte (Peruvian Institute of Sport). The increase in spectator capacity came after CONMEBOL chose Peru to host the Copa América 2004, prompting the Peruvian government to invest in a five-million dollar renovation program for its stadia, including the Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega. Its renovation cost approximately $1,720,000, which helped boost its official spectator capacity to 42,056. The stadium ended up hosting the third place game of the Copa América 2004. Thanks to the event, the city of Cusco received even more tourists than it already receives as Peru's top tourist destination. The Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega is also recognized as one of the most beautiful stadiums in all of South America. This recognition is due to its well-maintained grass and its resistance to the sometimes aggressive and highly variable climate of the city of Cuzco. The awe is the stadium's perpetual beauty even after these climates. It is this resistive beauty that inspires soccer commentators and visitors alike. The stadium is currently home to three football clubs. The first two original clubs since the 1950s are Cienciano of the Peruvian Second Division and Deportivo Garcilaso of the Copa Perú. The third is the recently formed club Real Garcilaso, which was promoted to the First Division at the end of 2011. This will set up a much anticipated Cusco derby match",

The team first participated in the Peruvian football league in 1919 in Lima and later was invited to the first true National football league, the Torneo Descentralizado, in 1966, when four teams from the provinces were invited to join the league. Joining them were Atlético Grau from Piura, Club Octavio Espinoza from Ica and Alfonso Ugarte (Ch) from Trujillo. Previously, only teams from Lima and Callao had been allowed to compete for the national championship. Due to a low finish the first year, Melgar was dropped from the league after the first year. After winning the Copa Perú they returned to the First Division where they have remained to this day. Melgar won the Torneo Descentralizado for the first time in 1981. In the 1983 season the club finished first in the First Stage and at the end the top six teams played a play-off tournament to determine the year's champion, which Melgar finished in second. FBC Melgar plays its home games at the Estadio Mariano Melgar, but since the Estadio de la UNSA was built in 1990 with a capacity of 40,000, it has used both.",

Finally, a third Juan Aurich football club achieved promotion in 1997 by winning the 1997 Copa Perú. This spell in the first division lasted from 1998 to 2002. The club's first major success was won in 2007 with the promotion to the Primera División via the Copa Perú.

        "strDescriptionEN": "Pirata F.C. is a Peruvian football club from the José Leonardo Ortiz District in the city of Chiclayo, Lambayeque Region. The team currently plays in the Liga 2 tournament. History The club was founded on November 15, 2010 in the José Leonardo Ortiz District. It is named after the brother of honorary president Luis Alberto Guevara. Molinos El Pirata is owned by G&B Molinos, a rice processing plant. El Pirata had a very successful maiden campaign which it started from the José Leonardo Ortiz District League in the Copa Perú. That year it finished the district league as runner-up and won the Chiclayo provincial league. It would then go on to become the Lambayeque departmental champion and qualify for the National Stage for the first time. In the national stage it finished 14th out of 50 with three games won, two draws, and only one defeat against Comercial Aguas Verdes. This was enough for El Pirata to qualify for the play-offs which it played against Racing de Huamachuco. It lost the first leg 4–0 in Huamachuco and was close to overturning the result by winning 0–3. The team had a short campaign in 2017 where it failed to overcome the Provincial Stage of the Copa Perú tournament. In 2018, Molinos El Pirata won the José Leonardo Ortiz district league, and was runner-up in the Chiclayo provincial league to qualify for the Lambayeque Departamental Stage. In that stage it was drawn into Group A where it faced local rivals Carlos Stein as well as JJ Arquitectura, AJEC, and Porvernir Miraflores. It qualified to the semifinals as second in its group to play Estudiantes Boca. In the finals it defeated Carlos Stein by 3–1 on a single leg match. In the National Stage, the team finished 3rd with of 50 with four games won and two drawn. A match between it and Carlos Stein was awarded to the latter. The last match of the group against UD Parachique, which ended in a draw, was awarded to Molinos El Pirata. The club then defeated Defensor Laure Sur by a global score of 4–4 and advance because of a better seed to the next stage. There it defeated Credicoop San Cristóbal by a global score of 5–4 to qualify for the final group stage or La Finalísima for the first time in its history. In the final group stage it defeated Santos by 4–0 on November 24. It was then defeated by Alianza Universidad on November 28 leaving all four final group teams with 3 points each. In the final matchday, December 2, Alianza Universidad defeated Santos by 5–2 on the first match which meant Molinos El Pirata needed only to defeat its last rival, Unión Deportivo Ascensión, by more than two goals to win the tournament. The final score was 6–0. Badge and colors The team uses a green as its primary color. Its first badge consisted of a generic image of a pirate which was quickly changed to an image of Disney's fictional character Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. The image of the character was placed inside a white circle which reads MOLINOS EL PIRATA on the upper half and JOSÉ LEONARDO ORTIZ at the bottom. After reaching the 2018 Copa Perú final group stage, the club changed its badge to that of a generic pirate drawing because of copyright infringement. Within days the generic pirate image was also taken down from the club's social media page as it too was used without permission. Before the first match of the final group stage, an image of a Jack Sparrow look-alike was unveiled by the team for use in their badge.",

The stadium was first inaugurated on 27 October 1952 for the 1953 South American Championship—replacing the Stadium Nacional—and is Peru's principal and national stadium. It has hosted three of the six South American Championship/Copa América football competitions held in Peru. It is referred to as the Coloso de José Díaz because of its proximity to a street of the same name. It is the home ground of the Peru national football team. The IPD (Peruvian Sport Institute)—a branch of the Ministry of Education—is the stadium's administrating entity. The stadium has undergone several renovations for tournaments such as the 2004 Copa América. The artificial turf was installed for the 2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship. It will probably be used at the 2021 FIFA U-17 World Cup. The most recent renovation started in 2010 and concluded in 2011. The re-inauguration ceremony of the renovated stadium was held on 24 July 2011 with a match between the Peru national under-20 football team and the Spain national under-20 football team.",

        "strDescriptionEN": "The Peru national football team represents Peru in men's international football. The national team has been organised, since 1927, by the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF). The FPF constitutes one of the 10 members of FIFA's South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). Peru has won the Copa América twice and qualified for FIFA World Cup finals five times (last appearing in 2018); it also participated in the 1936 Olympic football competition and has reached the semi-finals of the CONCACAF Gold Cup. The team plays most of its home matches at the Estadio Nacional in Lima, the country's capital. The team is well known for its white shirts adorned with a diagonal red stripe, which combine Peru's national colours. This basic design has been used continuously since 1936, and gives rise to the team's common Spanish nickname, la Blanquirroja (the white-and-red). Peruvian football fans are known for their distinctive cheer ¡Arriba Perú! (Onward Peru!). Peru has longstanding rivalries with Chile and Ecuador. The Peru national team enjoyed its most successful periods in the 1930s and the 1970s. In the 1930s, Peru took part in the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and enjoyed victories in the 1938 Bolivarian Games and the 1939 Copa América, with goalkeeper Juan Valdivieso and forwards Teodoro Fernández and Alejandro Villanueva playing important roles. In the 1970s, Peru qualified for three World Cups and won the Copa América in 1975, attaining worldwide recognition; the team then notably included defender Héctor Chumpitaz and the forward partnership of Hugo Sotil and Teófilo Cubillas, often regarded as Peru's greatest player. The national team's all-time top goalscorer is Paolo Guerrero, with 38 goals, and its most-capped player is Roberto Palacios, with 128 appearances. Under manager Ricardo Gareca, Peru placed third at the 2015 Copa América, reached the quarter-finals of the Copa América Centenario, participated in the group stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup finals, and earned second at the 2019 Copa América.",

The stadium was built in accordance with FIFA’s manual of technical specifications for World Cup finals. The stadium has hosted some of the Peru national football team's international matches including FIFA World Cup Qualifiers. It also hosted the final stages of the 2008 Copa Perú. However, the Monumental was absent from the organization of the 2004 Copa América because of conflicts between the club and the organizers. In addition, between its opening in 2000 until 2007, only one edition of the Peruvian Clásico was played due to security concerns; however, in late 2008, the derby returned to the stadium. On November 5th, 2019, the Estadio Monumental was selected by CONMEBOL to host the 2019 Copa Libertadores Final, after the outbreak of 2019 Chilean protests raised security concerns about the development of the match in Santiago, city initially chosen as host.",
