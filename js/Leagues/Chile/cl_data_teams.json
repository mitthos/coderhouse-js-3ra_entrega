        "strStadiumDescription": "The Estadio Monumental is a soccer Stadium in Macul, south-east of the centre of the Chilean capital Santiago. It serves as the home ground of Colo-Colo, and on occasions also for other clubs and the national football team. The stadium has a current spectator capacity of 47,347. The actual playing field is named after David Arellano, the founder of Colo-Colo, therefore, on occasions the whole stadium is referred to as Estadio Monumental David Arellano. The stadium was first opened in 1975 with a double-header in front of 25,599 people. In the first match Santiago Morning and Santiago Wanderers drew 1-1 and in the main event Colo-Colo defeated Deportes Aviación 1-0, Carlos Orellana being the scorer. However, the stadium proved unsuitable for ongoing use, and therefore only five more matches took place there for the time being. Completed in its current form in 1989, it was reopened in September of that year with a match between Colo-Colo and CA Peñarol from Uruguay, which the hosts won 2-1, thanks to goals by Marcelo Barticciotto and Leonel Herrera. The official capacity of the stadium then was between 62,500 and 65,000 spectators. The highest ever recorded attendance when 69,305 spectators saw a league match between Colo-Colo and Club Universidad de Chile in 1992. In the 2016-17 season, Colo-Colo drew an average home league attendance of 21,509 for the Apertura and 23,229 for the Clausura. The stadium was in 1991 home to the second Copa Libertadores final, won by Colo-Colo 3-0, making it the sole Chilean club to win the trophy. Accidents, including a fatality in 1993, instigated various modernisations which led to a reduction of the capacity to the current 47,000 spectators. The stadium is also rented out to club Santiago Morning and other Chilean teams that require holding games on the international tournament scale. It has also been used by the Chile national football team when the Estadio Nacional, the main football stadium of the country, is unavailable. The American rock band Pearl Jam played at the stadium on November 16, 2011, as part of their 20th anniversary tour. Its principal tenant and owner is the corporate entity Blanco y Negro that runs Colo-Colo and for which Chilean billionaire and President Sebastián Piñera is a major shareholder.",

The highest ever recorded attendance was on December 3, 1972 when 32,551 spectators saw the Primera Division match between Green Cross Temuco and Colo-Colo. In 2007 the stadium was selected as a venue for the 2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, and to comply with FIFA standards, its facilities were improved, its capacity was decreased from 20,930 to 18,936; and all seats were covered by a roof (from about 80% previously). The athletics track was removed to enhance spectators' enjoyment of the on-the-pitch action. The stadium was re-inaugurated on November 5, 2008. In 2013 the stadium was the main venue for the IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy. On April 27, 2013 it hosted a 2015 Rugby World Cup qualifying match between hosts nation Chile and Brazil.

Until 1984, the club was known as Green Cross – Temuco, and, in 2007, changed its name to Deportivo Temuco, only on that season. In 2013, the club merged with Unión Temuco, but the name of Deportes Temuco was kept, along with the logo and traditional white and green colors, making it seem as Deportes Temuco absorbing Unión rather than a fusion. Thanks to the fusion though, Deportes Temuco left the Segunda División and returned to Primera B for season 2013–14, using Unión Temuco's place in that league.",

Their home ground, Estadio Elías Figueroa Brander, is in the north-west of the city. Wanderers have played their games there since 1931 after moving from Barrio Puerto. Founded on the 15th of August 1892, it's the country's oldest club and the oldest football team in Latin America as well. There are four clubs older than Wanderers in Peru and Argentina, but none of those started out as football clubs and all of their football branches started after 1892. For this reason, Wanderers is known in Chile as the Decano del fútbol chileno (“The dean of Chilean football”) and forms part of Conmebol’s Club de los 100, section which congregates Latin-American teams founded over 100 years ago. In 2007, the club was declared as part of Valparaíso's intangible heritage. The club's home colours are green shirts and socks with white shorts, which are based on the colors of the Irish Football Association team. Wanderers have a fierce rivalry with neighbors Everton and the two sides contest the Clásico Porteño (Seaport Derby), the oldest derby in Chile, which started in 1916. Wanderers are historically the working-class club whereas Everton are considered to be from the richer tourism-orientated areas. In the club's early history, the club was a member of the local championship held in the Valparaíso Region called Liga Valparaíso, where it won seven titles. In 1926, the football associations in Chile were unified, and Valparaíso went into decline as the administrative center of the Chilean football. After this period, having joined the professional football association in 1944, the club has won three further league titles in 1958, 1968, and 2001. Wanderers have produced important players in Chilean football history like Elías Figueroa, who is considered the best Chilean footballer of all time, as well as one of the greatest defenders of football, alongside Franz Beckenbauer, according to FIFA. Other important players that Wanderers has produced for Chile have been David Pizarro and Eugenio Mena, who were both 2015 Copa América champions, the first ever title of the nation in this contest.",

Construction began in February 1937 and the stadium was inaugurated on December 3, 1938. The architecture was based on the Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany. The stadium was one of the venues for the FIFA World Cup in 1962, and hosted the final where Brazil defeated Czechoslovakia 3-1. In 1948, the stadium hosted the matches of the South American Championship of Champions, the competition that inspired the creation of the UEFA Champions League and of the Copa Libertadores. The stadium was notoriously used as a prison camp and torture facility by the military regime following the Chilean coup d'état. In 2009, a complete modernization plan was unveiled for the stadium and surrounding facilities. President Michelle Bachelet said it would become the most modern stadium in South America. The stadium will be the opening and closing ceremonies, athletics, and football venue for the 2014 South American Games and the 2023 Pan American Games.",
